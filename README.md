## 🧠 What You Will Find Inside

### ✔ Supervised Learning
Algorithms that learn from labeled data such as:
- Regression & Classification models  
- Tree-based models  
- Distance-based learning  
- Probabilistic models  
- Support Vector Machines  
- Model evaluation metrics  

### ✔ Unsupervised Learning
Algorithms that find patterns without labels:
