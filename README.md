# Machine-Learning
A complete collection of Machine Learning codes, including algorithms from scratch, data preprocessing, model building, and end-to-end ML projects. Organized, well-commented, and ideal for learning, revision, and showcasing practical ML skills.
This repository centralizes all my important work in Machine Learning. It is designed to help learners, beginners, and professionals understand ML concepts thoroughly by providing:
-Well-commented Python scripts
-Algorithm implementations (from scratch + using Scikit-Learn)
-Clear examples for preprocessing and model evaluation
-Organized folders for easy navigation
-Reusable templates for future ML tasks
-The focus of this repository is clarity, structure, and practical understanding.
